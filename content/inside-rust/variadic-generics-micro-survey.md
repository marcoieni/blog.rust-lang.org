We are launching a [Variadic Generic Micro Survey][survey-url].

This survey is meant to gather sentiment and use-cases for upcoming design discussions for adding [variadic generics](https://poignardazur.github.io/2021/01/30/variadic-generics/) to the Rust language. Its main goal is to answer the question "What do people want variadic generics *for*?". The answers will likely be used to steer an upcoming RFC for variadic generics.

The survey is only offered in the English language.

We invite you to take this survey even if you have limited Rust experience, or you're not familiar at all with the concept of variadic generics. Every data point helps up paint a clearer picture.

**You can fill out the survey [here][survey-url]**

Filling the survey should take you approximately 5 minutes, and the survey is fully anonymous. We will accept submissions until **Monday, October 20th, 2025**.

Please help us spread the word by sharing the survey link via your social networks, at meetups, with colleagues, and in any other community that makes sense to you.

Thank you!
