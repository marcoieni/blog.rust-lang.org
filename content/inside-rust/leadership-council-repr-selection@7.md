The September 2025 selections for [Leadership Council] representatives have been finalized. The [infrastructure team][infra] has chosen [Jakub Beránek] as their new representative. [TC], [Mara Bos], and [Oli Scherer] will continue to represent [lang], [libs], and [mods] respectively.

We'd like to give our thanks to outgoing representative [Mark Rousskov] for being instrumental to the formation of the Council and representing the infrastructure team these past two years. We've greatly appreciated Mark's support!

Thanks to everyone who participated in the process! The next representative selections will be in March 2026 for the other half of the Council.
